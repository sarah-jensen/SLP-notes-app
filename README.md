  # SLP Notes App
  
  ## Description
  This app was created to support school-based SLPs and SLPAs with documentation for services as caseloads continue to increase. It is intended to streamline the process for efficiently recording thorough treatment notes and make the process of service documentation less burdensome for providers. Additionally my hope is that the notes generated will contain enough specificity for SLPs to monitor and confidently report on student progress even when the bulk of direct services are delivered by an SLP Assistant. 
  
  ## Usage

  Users will select the applicable option from dropdown menus to describe the type of session, subjective observations of the student, treatment targets and activities, and the student's accuracy both independently and with specified supports. The user has the option to add additional treatment targets if applicable.
